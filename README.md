# Crypto-Chat-App-MERN-Stack-

Here, I created a chatting web application with end-to-end encryption using cryptography . 

Users can log in/register with the app add rooms and start chatting.

Encryption of messages is done using the Diffie Hellman key exchange algorithm along with the AES-256 algorithm.

It supports text, video, image, and voice-to-text messaging, all secured with end-to-end encryption.

UI is similar to WhatsApp web.

Technologies used:

Frontend: Reactjs
Backend: Nodejs, MongoDB, ExpressJs

Also used web-worker for the heavy task, since video and image encryption/decryption process was time-consuming.
